{b}Introduction
{n:intro}
RFTools Control is an addon mod for RFTools which adds a visual
programming system that is suitable for automation tasks. Programs
written with RFTools Control can move items around, interact with
redstone, examine energy levels of machines and so on. There is direct
support for the storage scanner and in the future it will also give
auto crafting abilities to that scanner.

Don't be too afraid of the word 'programming' though. Programs written
for RFTools Control are typically very simple and they are also written
in a visual manner. That means you don't actually have to 'write' code.
Instead you drag icons on a grid.

{b}The Programmer
{n:programmer}
{rb:programmer}
The Programmer is the basic block where you create your programs. To
use it you need to insert a program card item:
{ri:program_card}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}The Processor
{n:processor}
{rb:processor}
The Processor is the device that actually runs your programs. First you
write a program with the Programmer and then you insert that card in
the processor. Up to 6 program cards are supported. The Processor needs
some more modules before it can really work though.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The most important thing that the Processor needs is at least one cpu
core. For every core that you install in one of the 16 expansion slots
you can run an additional program at the same time. Note that cpu cores
are expensive but you don't always need many even if you plan to run
multiple programs because typical programs don't run very long.

There are three tiers of cpu cores. They differ in their execution speed
and the RF/t energy consumption.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The Processor can store up to 32 variables. To do that it needs RAM chips.
Every RAM chip adds 8 variables so maximum 4 RAM chips are supported.
